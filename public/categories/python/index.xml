      <description>When you want to do a full count on your tables in django, you often do it like this:
MyModel.objects.count()  which will produce a sql like this:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS &amp;quot;__count&amp;quot; FROM &amp;quot;myapp_mymodel&amp;quot;  Which is pretty fine most of the time, but what happens if you have a lot of data and rows on your table? Then for instance in my experience it took 20 seconds to count all the rows in a table!</description>
