I was personally fascinated by the materials i these websites. Every time I look at the work has been done on these sites I get a small tangling feeling in my head. To be honest I'm blown away by some of em. 

Learning to program isn't just about learning the syntax or how to just combine things together. 
As [Zi Chong Kao](https://kaomorphism.com/) says : "Learning to program is learning a mental model"

I've gathered some of my favorite resources to learn the needed engineering part (like syntax, etc) together with mentality model of programming for the convenience of myself and others who want to deepen their knowledge on programming and have the mentality model of a programmer. 

I'm going to constantly add to this list as I'm going on this endless journey.

* [Select Star SQL](https://selectstarsql.com/)
This is an interactive book which aims to be the best place on the internet for learning SQL. It is free of charge, free of ads and doesn't require registration or downloads.
You will learn SQL working on a dataset which documents Texas death row inmates executed from 1976 when the Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty, to the present.
As the writer quotes: "On one level, the data is simply a part of a mundane programming book. On another, each row represents immense suffering, lives lost, and in some cases amazing redemption and acceptance."
